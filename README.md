# 🎮 Game Centre

Welcome to **Game Centre**, a multi-game console application built as the final project for our *Introduction to Computer Science (IC)* course during the **second semester of our first year** at **IIT Jodhpur (Batch of 2024)**.

This application combines fun with learning by incorporating classic games and fundamental programming concepts like UI handling, user authentication, logic development, and file management—all done **without any graphics libraries**.

## 🧠 Objective

The aim of this project was to:

- Apply theoretical concepts from the IC course in a practical, interactive project.
- Collaboratively design and develop a software system.
- Explore game logic, user interaction, and basic file operations.
- Learn to manage a codebase as a team using Git and GitHub.

## 🎯 Features

### 🕹️ Games Included

- **2048**  
  A sliding tile puzzle game where the goal is to reach the tile numbered 2048.

- **Minesweeper**  
  A logic game where players uncover tiles and avoid hidden mines.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  A classic game with both:
  - **Single-player mode** (vs. computer)
  - **Two-player mode** (player vs. player)
